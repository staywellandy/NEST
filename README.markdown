# NEST

*Strongly typed Elasticsearch client*

NEST aims to be a .net client with a very concise API. Its main goal is to provide a solid strongly typed Elasticsearch client. It also has string/dynamic overloads for more dynamic usecases. 

Indexing is as simple as:

	var post = new Post() { Id = 12, ... }
	var result = client.Index(post);

Indexing asynchronously is as easy as:

	//t is a Task<ConnectionStatus>
	var t = client.IndexAsync(post);

Searching is fluent:

	var results = this.ConnectedClient.Search<ElasticSearchProject>(s => s
			.From(0)
			.Size(10)
			.Fields(f => f.Id, f => f.Name)
			.SortAscending(f => f.LOC)
			.SortDescending(f => f.Name)
			.Query(q=>q.Term(f=>f.Name, "NEST", Boost: 2.0))
	);

A special shoutout to [@stephenpope](http://github.com/stephenpope) for allowing his port 
of the java factory based dsl [Rubber](http://github.com/stephenpope/Rubber) to be merged into NEST. 
NEST now has **two types of query dsl's** (lambda and factory based)!

Many thanks to my employer [Q42](http://www.q42.nl) for supporting the development of NEST by donating 20% of my contract hours for NEST's development. That means I get a full paid day to work on NEST a week, whoohoo!
