# Introduction

NEST aims to be a .net client with a very concise API. Its main goal is to provide a solid strongly typed Elasticsearch client. It also has string/dynamic overloads for more dynamic usecases. 

Indexing is as simple as:

	var post = new Post() { Id = 12, ... }
	client.Index(post);

Indexing asynchronously is as easy as:

	//IndexAsync returns a Task<ConnectionStatus>
	var task = client.IndexAsync(post);

Searching is fluid:

	var results = this.ConnectedClient.Search<ElasticSearchProject>(s => s
			.From(0)
			.Size(10)
			.Fields(f => f.Id, f => f.Name)
			.SortAscending(f => f.LOC)
			.SortDescending(f => f.Name)
			.Query(q=>q.Term(f=>f.Name, "NEST", Boost: 2.0))
	);

## Installing 

Nest can be installed through NuGet:

	PM> Install-Package NEST

Or searching for "elasticsearch" will get you to nest as well.

A special shoutout to [@stephenpope](http://github.com/stephenpope) for allowing his port

NEST now has **two types of query dsl's** (lambda and factory based)!
